# ChessGame
Basic Chess game for a final project in CS 260 at DSU Fall 2020

Files contain 2 projects for a program in Visual Studio: GuiChess.csproj and Chess.csproj

To test project zip GuiChess folder and save files. Open GuiChess.sln project in Microsoft Visual Studio.

As of now there are several implementations that are not functioning correctly. I could not get AI to function correctly 
so the program just lets you move your own pieces without a response. StateOfPlay and ChessGame are the backbones files
for the game. ChessGame implements the GUI. I will continue to develop the program to fix its flaws.
